This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare.

Included is a list of some places in YaoundÃ©, Cameroon that I can recall I used to go when I attended my primary studies. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡² 

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map.
